When one is deciding where to start a business, it might make sense to start by doing a top down analysis of the global economy. One way to approach this is to start from Gross World Product and break it into a hierarchy of economic sectors.

I do this using OECD data:

- https://data.oecd.org/natincome/value-added-by-activity.htm
- https://data.oecd.org/price/inflation-cpi.htm

Here are the results:
