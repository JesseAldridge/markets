When one is deciding where to start a business, it might make sense to start by doing a top down analysis of the global economy. One way to approach this is to start from Gross World Product and break it into a hierarchy of economic sectors.

I do this using OECD data:
- https://data.oecd.org/gdp/gross-domestic-product-gdp.htm
- https://data.oecd.org/natincome/value-added-by-activity.htm
- https://data.oecd.org/price/inflation-cpi.htm

Here are the results:

Note:
There the OECD data is incomplete - many values are missing for various sectors from various countries at various time windows, as demonstrated in the graph below:

Missing data explains most most of the oddities in the graph (e.g. the flat lines prior to 1990 and the dip in 2018). Generally the values from 1990 to 2017 are fairly complete.
