When one is deciding where to start a business, it might make sense to start by doing a top down analysis of the global economy. One approach is to start from Gross World Product and break it into a hierarchy of economic subsectors.

I've started with OECD data:
- https://data.oecd.org/gdp/gross-domestic-product-gdp.htm
- https://data.oecd.org/natincome/value-added-by-activity.htm
- https://data.oecd.org/price/inflation-cpi.htm

Here are the top-level results:

Note:

The OECD data is incomplete - many values are missing for various sectors in various countries at various time intervals, as illustrated in the graph below:

Missing data explains most most of the oddities in the graph (e.g. the flat lines prior to 1990 and the dip in 2018). Generally the values from 1990 to 2017 are fairly complete.
